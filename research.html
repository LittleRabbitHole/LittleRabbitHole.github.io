       <h3> Wikipedia Education Project </h3>
       <p> This project intends to explore and evaluate the Wikipedia Education (Wiki Ed) program as an institutionalized socialization program for engaging student newcomers to online production communities, such as Wikipedia.
         More specifically, we evaluated the impact of Wiki Ed program on the quality and quantity of production in Wikipedia and studied what elements of Wiki Ed contributed to its success or failure.</p>

        <h3> Breaking events in Wikipedia </h3>
        <p> This project involves two sub projects. The first project aims to explore the value and impact of breaking events on engaging newcomers into the online production communities, such as Wikipedia.
          More specifically, we evaluate the influence of the recent breaking events (e.g, Black Lives Matter social movement, Charlottesville rally, etc.) on the newcomers, and study how we can utilize such breaking events to recruit and engage newcomers.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The second project aims to describe the present state of Wikipedia reporting current events across the three most spoken languages in the world: Chinese, Spanish, and English.
          More specifically, we study the process of the production and the resulting quality of all the current event highlighted on the ‘In the News” section of the main page of Wikipedia from 2011 to 2018, and understand how those current events are represented across different Wikipedia language communities.</p>
