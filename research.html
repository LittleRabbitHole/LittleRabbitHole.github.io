       <h1> <strong>Engaging Newcomers for Online Production Communities </strong></h2>

       <h2> <strong>Wikipedia Education Project </strong></h2>
       <p> This project intends to explore and evaluate the Wikipedia Education (Wiki Ed) program as an institutionalized socialization program for engaging student newcomers to online production communities, such as Wikipedia.
         More specifically, we evaluated the impact of Wiki Ed program on the quality and quantity of production in Wikipedia and studied what elements of Wiki Ed contributed to its success or failure.

         <ul>
           <li>Utilized a mixed-method approach, we evaluated the impact of Wiki Ed program on the quality and quantity of production in Wikipedia.</li>
           <li>Developed a coding scheme and utilized the qualitative content analysis method to understand how different types of the communications could help to engage student newcomers. </li>
           <li>Analyzed a total of 18,360 student editors from Wiki Ed program and their editing activities over the past 2 years, we investigated what elements of Wiki Ed contributed to its success or failure.</li>
           <li>The results provide insights on how to design systems to better engage new users and encourage their contributions.</li>
         </ul>


        <h2> <strong>Breaking events in Wikipedia </strong> </h2>
        <p> This project aims to explore the value and impact of breaking events on engaging newcomers into the online production communities, such as Wikipedia.
          <br> Github: <a href="https://github.com/LittleRabbitHole/WikiEvent">Keeping up on Current Events! A Case Study of Newcomers to Wikipedia</a>.
        <ul>
          <li>Studied three major current events in 2014, their related articles and their editors’ behavior in Wikipedia.</li>
          <li>Collected large-scale user behavior data for those events article editors and their contributed content.</li>
          <li>Utilized the multilevel regression analysis, social network analysis and survival analysis to evaluate the influence of the current events on the newcomers, and study how we can utilize such breaking events to recruit and engage newcomers.</li>
          <li>Developed a coding scheme and utilized the qualitative content analysis to study how different types of feedbacks could help to engage new users.</li>
          <li>The results provide insights on how the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation works differently for engaging new users in the user generated content systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1> <strong>Biases in Online Production Communities </strong></h2>
        <h2> <strong>Wikipedia in representation of worldwide events</strong> </h2>
        <p>This project aims to describe the present state of Wikipedia reporting current events across the three most spoken languages in the world: Chinese, Spanish, and English.
          More specifically, we study the process of the production and the resulting quality of all the current event highlighted on the "In the News” section of the main page of Wikipedia from 2011 to 2018, and understand how those current events are represented across different Wikipedia language communities.
        <ul>
          <li>Collect and process 3,000 worldwide events and 7,000 related Wikipedia articles from 2011 to 2018, along with all editors’ activities for one month after the events happened.</li>
          <li>Utilize the natural language process techniques to process the content and extract the article level features.</li>
          <li>Utilize unsupervised machine learning methods to provide a quality measure for each article revision. This quality measure is highly correlated with the human-coded quality.</li>
          <li>Study the process of the editors’ contribution, production and the article quality of all the current event related articles, and understand how those current events are represented across different Wikipedia language communities.</li>
          <li>Our results provide evidence for the unbiased representation of worldwide events across different Wikipedia language communities.</li>
        </ul>
