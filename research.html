        <h1> <strong>Collaboration and Open Content in Social Media </strong></h2>
          <p> In facing breaking news events, people have traditionally relied on mass media to seek updated information about them by turning on the TV, listening to the radio, or checking the newspaper. Nowadays with the advantage of social technologies, there has been a significant shift in ways that people gather and communicate news, and increasingly open content in social media has become an important source of news. Based on a 2018 survey conducted by the PEW research center, 25% of the U.S. adults get their news via social media -- this number is even slightly higher than the share who often do so from print newspapers (16%).
          <br>
          <br> Rich prior literature in the field of communication has studied the news reporting process in conventional mass media, and found that <strong>gatekeepers</strong> play an important role in the process. Traditionally, gatekeepers are largely newsrooms editors or journalists who control the information through selecting or filtering what gets published to the public, and thus they have a unique power in spreading of information. In contrast, the process of how open content are created by contributors in social media platforms is different in terms of who are able to involve in the publication process, the collaboartion, and the organization structure. Especially, it is unclear who are gatekeepers in social media platforms and how do they influence the content creation and spread of information in social media. In my PhD dissertation, I aim to understand this new model of content generation process in a variety of social media platforms, including Twitter, Reddit, and Wikipedia. Each of these platforms represent a different degree of collaboration process, moderation process, and different community norms. I aim to discover ways in identifying gatekeepers in these different social media platforms and assess their impact in information quality and spread of information.

          <h2>Relevant Projects:</h2>
          <h4> <strong>Wikipedia in representation of worldwide events</strong> </h4>
          <p>This project aims to describe the present state of Wikipedia reporting current events across the three most spoken languages in the world: Chinese, Spanish, and English.
          More specifically, we study the process of the production and the resulting quality of all the current event highlighted on the "In the News” section of the main page of Wikipedia from 2011 to 2018, and understand how those current events are represented across different Wikipedia language communities. Our results provide evidence for the unbiased representation of worldwide events across different Wikipedia language communities.

          <h4> <strong>Breaking events in Wikipedia </strong> </h4>
          <p> This project aims to explore the value and impact of breaking events on engaging newcomers into the online production communities, such as Wikipedia. The results provide insights on how the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation works differently for engaging new users in the user generated content systems.

          <h1> <strong>Other Projects</strong></h2>

             <h4> <strong>Wikipedia Education Project </strong></h4>
             <p> This project intends to explore and evaluate the Wikipedia Education (Wiki Ed) program as an institutionalized socialization program for engaging student newcomers to online production communities, such as Wikipedia. More specifically, we evaluated the impact of Wiki Ed program on the quality and quantity of production in Wikipedia and studied what elements of Wiki Ed contributed to its success or failure. Our results provide insights on how to design systems to better engage new users and encourage their contributions.
