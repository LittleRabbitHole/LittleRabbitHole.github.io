        <h1> <strong>Collaboration and Open Content in Social Media </strong></h2>
          <p> In facing breaking news events, people have traditionally relied on mass media to seek updated information about them by turning on the TV, listening to the radio, or checking the newspapers. Nowadays with the advantage of social technologies, there has been a significant shift in ways that people gather and communicate news, and increasingly open content in social media has become an important source of news. Based on a 2018 survey conducted by the PEW research center, 25% of the U.S. adults get their news via social media -- this number is even slightly higher than the share who often do so from print newspapers (16%).
          <br>
          <br> Rich prior literature in the field of communication has studied the news reporting process in conventional mass media, and found that <strong>gatekeepers</strong> play an important role in the process. Traditionally, gatekeepers are largely newsrooms editors or journalists who control the information through selecting or filtering what gets published to the public, and thus they have a unique power in spreading of information. In contrast, the process of how open content are created by contributors in social media platforms is different in terms of who are able to involve in the publication process, the collaboartion, and the organization structure. Especially, it is unclear who are gatekeepers in social media platforms and how do they influence the content creation and spread of information in social media. In my PhD dissertation, I aim to understand this new model of content generation process in a variety of social media platforms, including Twitter, Reddit, and Wikipedia. Each of these platforms represent a different degree of collaboration process, moderation process, and different community norms. I aim to discover ways in identifying gatekeepers in these different social media platforms and assess their impact in information quality and spread of information.
          <br>
          <br> My goal of the dissertation work is to establish a theoretical understanding on the open content generation process in social media platforms and the role of gatekeepers in this process, as well as to provide guidance and support for information scientists, technology developers and community practitioners seeking to build social media platforms that can generate inclusive information that is both high quality and represents diverse perspectives.

          <h2>Relevant Projects:</h2>
          <h4> <strong>Breaking events in Wikipedia </strong> </h4>
          <p> This project aims to explore the value and impact of breaking events on engaging newcomers into the online production communities, such as Wikipedia. The results provide insights on how the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation works differently for engaging new users in the user generated content systems.

          <h4> <strong>Wikipedia in representation of worldwide events</strong> </h4>
          <p>This project aims to describe the present state of Wikipedia reporting current events across the three most spoken languages in the world: Chinese, Spanish, and English.
          More specifically, we study the process of the production and the resulting quality of all the current event highlighted on the "In the News” section of the main page of Wikipedia from 2011 to 2018, and understand how those current events are represented across different Wikipedia language communities. Our results provide evidence for the unbiased representation of worldwide events across different Wikipedia language communities.

          <h1> <strong> User Modeling </strong> </h1>
          <p> My recent work in Spotify research involves using both qualitative and data-driven methods to investigate users' online audio streaming habits. The results uncover the different behavior patterns when users interact with the streaming platform and provide design implications on how to improve the current platform to better support users.

          <h4> <strong> Music search mindset: </strong> </h4>
          <p> Music listening is a commonplace activity that has transformed as users engage with online streaming platforms. When presented with anytime, anywhere access to a vast catalog of music, users face challenges in searching for what they want to hear. We propose that users who engage in domain-specific search (e.g., music search) have different information-seeking needs than in general search. Using a mixed-method approach that combines a large-scale user survey with behavior data analyses, we describe the construct of search mindset on a leading online streaming music platform and then investigate two types of search mindsets: focused, where a user is looking for one thing in particular, and non-focused, where a user is open to different results. Our results reveal that searches in the music domain are more likely to be focused than non-focused. In addition, users' behavior (e.g., clicks, streams, querying, etc.) on a music search system is influenced by their search mindset. Finally, we propose design implications for music search systems to best support their users.

          <h1> <strong>Other Projects</strong></h2>
          <h4> <strong> Wikipedia Education </strong> </h4>
          <p> This project intends to explore and evaluate the Wikipedia Education (Wiki Ed) program as an institutionalized socialization program for engaging student newcomers to online production communities, such as Wikipedia. More specifically, we evaluated the impact of Wiki Ed program on the quality and quantity of production in Wikipedia and studied what elements of Wiki Ed contributed to its success or failure. Our results provide insights on how to design systems to better engage new users and encourage their contributions.
